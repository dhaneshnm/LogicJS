	//3.Pass user program to execute module,ie call execute module
	//4.execut module runs the simulation and returns result
	//5.Incvoke AI module and pass the result
	//6.AI module computes all possible paths and computes the user score.	
	//7.If score is above 8,player repeat game loop for level2
	//8.if score less than at,wait player to hit "replay".
